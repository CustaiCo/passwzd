This program uses the code for working with the password databases
directly from the sources for password safe on sourceforge.  Because it
uses the exact same code as the primary project, all password databases
should be fully supported.  The files in libs/, libcore.a and libos.a,
provided in binary form here, can be found obtained by compiling Password
Safe with a few custom options.

Unless some care is taken, the size of the resulting binaries can be very
large, almost 1mb each. The supplied lto.patch may be used to patch the
Makefiles of the sources from the Password Safe website. The Makefile in
src/core/ has been edited to remove the dependencies on libxerces-c. I
have also added the option to enable extra info in the binaries for
link-time optimization, and changed them to use gcc-ar as the manual
pages claim that normal ar will not be able to correctly preserve the
lto info in the object file.

You want to set  NO_YUBI=1 in the environment for the build and make
unicoderelease build.  'NO_YUBI=1 make unicoderelease' as one line should
do it. The lib/unicoderelease/ folder will have the archive files. The
header files in the included source have been slightly modified to use
a flat directory structure, and there is also a modified keyutils.h that
has the code needed for it to link properly with c++.
